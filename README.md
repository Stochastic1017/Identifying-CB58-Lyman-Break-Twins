# Finding the Cosmic Needle: Unraveling CB58 Resemblance in a Galactic Haystack

This project involves finding a new gravitationally-lensed Lyman-break galaxy that most closely resembles the target spectrum CB58. Lyman-break galaxy are a star-forming galaxy at high redshift that are selected using the differing appearance of the galaxy in several imaging filters due to the position of the Lyman limit. The spectral signals were captured using SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) which is a major multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The data was provided by University of Wisconsin - Madison astronomer Christy Tremonti, also a member of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) collaboration.
